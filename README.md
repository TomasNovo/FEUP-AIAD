Programming in Java with Jade for AIAD 2019/2020 at FEUP.

## 1. Project 1 - Clients and CPUs

As 1st project of AIAD, we created a multiple agent system with two agents:  


• *Client* - this agent wants to compile a project and has a deadline. 


• *CPU* - this agent receives some files of the project of the Client and if the compilation of the files can be done in the respective deadline, the CPU will compile the files that he received and will send them to Client. If not, CPU will preview a new deadline and will negotiate with the Client. 

According to Client's tolerance, he will accept or reject the negotiation and will communicate his decision to the CPU.

The objective of this project was to decrease the total compilation of the files of the Client's project. This objective was successfully accomplished.
